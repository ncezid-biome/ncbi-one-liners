To add a new tip or trick, please do the following:

1. Add it to `README.md` with a description and example code
2. Create a unit test under `test/` using the documentation here: https://github.com/kward/shunit2 or https://github.com/holmesjr/bash-spec-2.  You must use the appropriate file extension as described here: https://github.com/vargiuscuola/gen-sh-unittest
